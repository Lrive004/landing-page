# Landing-Page

A very simple and clean landing page showcasing my knowledge so far of HTML and CSS.
The application showcases my understanding of manipulating elements with flexbox. I Will be revisiting the application through time and with future gained knowledge to refactor any code that can be cleaner as well as making it mobile friendly.
